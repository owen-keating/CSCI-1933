3. I did not work with a partner for this assignment.

4. The main function in the program is located in the FractalDrawer.java file. In order
to compile the program, the user should have the directory for the source code open in
command prompt and type the command 'javac FractalDrawer.java' - after the code
compiles, the user can type the command 'java FractalDrawer' any amount of times that
they want to run the program. Any time the user wants to rerun the program, they must
close out the Canvas window and retype the 'java FractalDrawer' command. When the
program is run, the command prompt will output 'Shape? ', and the user should type
in the shape(triangle, rectangle, circle) that they would like to create a fractal
out of. The first letter of the shape is not case-sensitive(triangle vs. Triangle is
okay).

5. The program assumes that the user will run the program once for every fractal they
wish to display. For example, to display a rectangle fractal and then a circle fractal,
the user should first run the program and enter "rectangle" for the input. The program
will then display the rectangle and the user will have to close out the window to run
the program again for the circle fractal. The program also assumes that the user will
run the program over again if they input an invalid shape name. While I did include a
message that will display to the user when they have entered an invalid shape, there
is no loop in the program to ask the user for a valid shape name.

6. There are no known bugs that I am aware of in the program. I also did not consult
any outside sources for this assignment.

7. I certify that the information contained in this README file is complete and
accurate. I have both read and followed the course policies in the 'Academic Integrity -
Course Policy' section of the course syllabus.
