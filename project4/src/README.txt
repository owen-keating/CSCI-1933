3. I did not work with a partner for this assignment.

4. There are two total files that have to do with this submission, which includes
the README document as well as the MyMaze.java class. As far as running the programs,
the user should have the test file (MyMaze.java) downloaded to the same location as the
helper files, which includes NGen.java, StackGen.java, Stack1Gen.java, and Cell.java.
From there the user can run compile the MyMaze file through the terminal by navigating
to the correct location that holds the source material. The user should then type in
the command "javac MyMaze.java" and press enter. After the code compiles, the user
can type in the command "java MyMaze" however many times they wish to test the program.

5. The program assumes that the user has access to the StackGen interface as well as
the given helper classes described above. The implementation of the data structures
described in these files were a key component of this project. The user should also
know that I was unable to implement the solveMaze() function. For this reason, there
will be no path from start to finish that will appear in the terminal. Instead, the
command prompt should simply display a randomized maze with no stars as were included
in the examples. I did not decide to use any helper functions in this project because
I felt that the material was generally straight forward, and I believe that no
particular method got too long to a point where I needed to reorganize my code.

6. There is one function that I was not able to correctly build for this assignment.
While I was successful in creating a randomized maze and displaying it to the terminal,
I was unable to implement the solveMaze() function. However, I do not believe that my
inability to implement this function should affect any of my other class elements.
For this assignment, I did not consult outside sources.

7. I certify that the information contained in this README file is complete and
accurate. I have both read and followed the course policies in the 'Academic Integrity -
Course Policy' section of the course syllabus.
