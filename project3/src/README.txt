3. I did not work with a partner for this assignment.

4. There are four total files that have to do with this submission, which includes
the README, the LinkedList class, the ArrayList class, and the runtime analysis
document. As far as running the programs, the user should have the test files
(ArrayListTest.java and LinkedListTest.java) downloaded to the same location as the
submitted source material. From there the user can run compile both programs
using the IntelliJ studio, and the JUNIT testing protocol should display a score
for both programs. In addition, I have done my best to explain the runtime analysis
that pertains to four different functions in the program.

5. The program assumes that the user has access to the List interface provided on
the canvas page. The interface not only provides a blueprint for the two different
types of lists, but it also explains what the purpose of each function is. I only used
two additional helper functions in my program. expand() is used in the ArrayList program
to double the size of the current array when the size of the list has grown equivalent to
the length of the array. checkSorted() updates the status of the instance variable
"is sorted." It is used in several other functions including add(), remove(), and reverse().

6. There are two functions that I was not able to correctly build for this assignment.
While my ArrayList.java file was completed to the best of my ability, I was not able to
complete the sort() and merge() algorithms in the LinkedList.java file. However, with the
testing protocol that is in place (JUNIT), I don't believe this should affect any of my
other class elements. For this assignment, I did not consult outside sources.

7. I certify that the information contained in this README file is complete and
accurate. I have both read and followed the course policies in the 'Academic Integrity -
Course Policy' section of the course syllabus.
